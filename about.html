            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>CycleTopCalculator.com was created with a singular mission: to empower Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors with data-driven insights and strategic tools to navigate the complex and cyclical nature of the crypto market. We believe that understanding these cycles is key to long-term success and strategic profit-taking.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to demystify market movements, providing clarity and confidence to investors at all levels, from beginners to seasoned pros.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Bitcoin Cycles</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin's price history is characterized by distinct cycles of boom and bust, often influenced by factors like the Halving event, market sentiment, and adoption trends. CycleTopCalculator.com is designed to help you identify where we likely stand in the current cycle.</p>
            <p>By leveraging well-regarded on-chain and technical indicators, our platform provides a comprehensive view of the market's health and potential overheating or undervaluation. This approach moves beyond emotional trading and focuses on objective data.</p>

            <h2>How the Tool Works: Key Indicators</h2>
            <p>Our platform integrates several powerful tools to offer a holistic view of the market:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>200-Week Moving Average Floor:</strong> This is a critical long-term trend indicator. Historically, it has acted as a strong support level or "floor" for Bitcoin's price during bear markets. Our tool tracks how far the current price is from this floor, helping to gauge the market's position relative to its historical baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Sentiment (Fear & Greed Index):</strong> The crypto market is heavily driven by emotion. This index measures the overall sentiment—whether it's extreme fear, neutral, or extreme greed. Understanding sentiment can help you avoid selling during panic or buying during euphoria.</li>
                <li><strong>Halving Cycle Tracker:</strong> The Bitcoin Halving, which occurs roughly every four years, is a major event that reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Our tracker visually shows where we are in relation to the past and future halvings, which has historically been a catalyst for market cycles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By synthesizing these data points, CycleTopCalculator.com aims to provide a clearer picture for your investment decisions, helping you identify potential accumulation zones and strategically plan your exit during cycle tops.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Self-Custody</h2>
            <p>Beyond market analysis, we strongly advocate for the security and sovereignty of your digital assets. The fundamental principle of "Not your keys, not your coins" is central to our philosophy. Leaving your Bitcoin on exchanges exposes you to risks like hacks, insolvency, and account freezing.</p>
            <p>We highly recommend taking control of your Bitcoin by using a reputable hardware wallet, such as Trezor. This is the most secure way to protect your wealth from online threats and ensure that you truly own your assets.</p>

            <h2>About the Creator</h2>
            <p>CycleTopCalculator.com was built by a passionate Bitcoin enthusiast and developer who recognized the need for a centralized, easy-to-use platform that combines key cycle indicators with practical tools for strategy and security. This project is a contribution to the crypto community, aimed at helping others make more informed and secure decisions.</p>

            <p>Thank you for using CycleTopCalculator.com. We hope our tools prove invaluable in your Bitcoin journey.</p>
